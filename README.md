# react-strapi
This is a project containing two folders that operate as a full stack environment for React which pulls data from a Strapi backend. The two have already been linked using Apollo and React has Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap installed

## Using this project
To use this project simply clone it and then run 'yarn install' in both the frontend and backend projects. From there you can set the Strapi password and add some data which you can then query in the React project using graphql and Apollo.
